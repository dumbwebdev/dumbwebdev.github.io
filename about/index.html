<h1>about us</h1>
<hr>
<p>we&#39;re an endogenic <a href="https://pluralityresource.org/plurality-information/">plural system</a>!</p>
<p>&quot;we&quot; refers to either the collective or the system. we created the neopronouns &quot;wi/uz/ar/arz/arself&quot; to refer to the body as its own thing.</p>
<p>sometimes, but not too commonly, we may use the word &quot;I&quot;. this refers to me (wow, crazy), the only host in the system.</p>
<p>me and my headmate (there&#39;s only one) make up the collective. in our case, &quot;system&quot; refers to the body and the collective combined.</p>
